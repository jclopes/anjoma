Done:
 - Map representation
 - Path finding
 - Basic collision detection

TODO:
 - Ants need to move in direction to food or hives
 - check the A* algo for pathfinding to food and hive
 
 - speedup hacks: convert fun() to real functions; replace list comprehensions with lists:map
 - Oponent hills are seen as food
 - Enemy ants are ignored
 - Own ants are ignored
 - after a detour try to get back to original path
 - there are some problems calculating the positions on the map limits
